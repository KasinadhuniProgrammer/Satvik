        <p id="one">Hi. I'm Satvik Kasinadhuni, a Software geek and Cricket enthusiast from Connecticut.</p>

        <p id="two">I touched into coding at the age of 10 but started taking it more seriously since 2 years back. I love to learn and work with React, JavaScript, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebase, and many more things. I have experience in Software Engineering from interning at <a id="link" href="https://ipserlab.com/" target="_blank">IpserLab</a>, a startup company based in Mountain View, CA. I interned there from Feb 2021 - Dec 2021 as a Frontend Developer, and then started interning there again in June as a WebRTC Engineer.</p>

        <p id="three">When I am not coding, the only thing I am doing is watching Cricket. Cricket has been part of me ever since I was a small child. I love watching international matches and domestic franchises such as the IPL. My favorite format of the sport is Test Cricket. Even though it is very long, I think it truly shows what cricket is about, and I love spending hours and hours watching matches and looking at analysis/highlights.</p>
